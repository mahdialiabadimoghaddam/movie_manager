# movie_manager

A simple Python application to help you choose a movie from a downloaded archive 

## The story behind

I have been downloading films and after a while I lost track of them and I would be confused every time I tried to choose a movie that matched my mood.

So, I created this aplication which scans a directory and generates search links for the files.
I would also like to add more functionalities like searching for imdb score in future, so stick around :)

## Running the program

1. [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [install](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+python+in+windows) Python
2. clone the project

    ```bash
    cd your/desired/path
    ```

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahdialiabadimoghaddam/movie_manager.git
    ```

3. setup ```config.py.sample```
    * rename it to config.py
    * assign proper values to **all** variables
4. run the script, using:

    ```bash
    Python main.py
    ```
